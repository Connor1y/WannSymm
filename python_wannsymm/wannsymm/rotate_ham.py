# TODO: Translate from src/rotate_ham.h and src/rotate_ham.c
#
# Original C files: src/rotate_ham.h (29 lines) + src/rotate_ham.c (861 lines)
# Total lines: 890 (SECOND LARGEST MODULE)
# Complexity: High
# Estimated effort: 15-20 hours
#
# Translation notes:
# - Core symmetrization algorithm
# - Performance-critical code - use numpy vectorization
# - Complex matrix operations on large Hamiltonians
# - R-vector transformations under symmetry
# - Consider using numba for hot loops
#
# Key concepts:
# 1. Real-space Hamiltonian: H(R) matrix elements
# 2. Symmetry operation: (rot, trans) or (rot, trans, time-reversal)
# 3. Hamiltonian transformation: H'(R') = U† H(R) U
# 4. R-vector transformation: R' = rot·R
# 5. Symmetrization: Average over all symmetries
#
# Main algorithm:
# For each symmetry operation S:
#   1. Transform R-vectors: R' = S·R
#   2. Find matching R' in original set
#   3. Construct basis rotation U
#   4. Rotate Hamiltonian: H(R') = U† H(R) U
#   5. Average: H_symm = (1/N_symm) Σ_S H_S
#
# Functions to translate:
# - rotate_hamiltonian: Rotate H(R) by symmetry
# - transform_rvector: Transform R by rotation
# - find_transformed_rvec: Find R' in R-vector list
# - symmetrize_hamiltonian: Average over symmetries
# - expand_rvectors: Add missing R-vectors
# - check_hamiltonian_consistency: Validate result
# - apply_time_reversal: Handle time-reversal symmetry
# - Many helper functions for R-vector manipulation
#
# Performance considerations:
# - This is the computational bottleneck
# - Use numpy broadcasting where possible
# - Consider sparse matrix representations
# - May need parallelization for large systems
