Symmetry reading module for WannSymm

Reads symmetry operations from files and interfaces with spglib.
Translated from: src/readsymm.h and src/readsymm.c

Translation Status: ‚è≥ NOT STARTED

# TODO: Translate from src/readsymm.h and src/readsymm.c
#
# Original C files: src/readsymm.h (13 lines) + src/readsymm.c (75 lines)
# Total lines: 88
# Complexity: Low-Medium
# Estimated effort: 3-4 hours
#
# Translation notes:
# - Use spglib Python bindings (pip install spglib)
# - Read symmetry operations from use_symmetry file if provided
# - Otherwise, find symmetries automatically with spglib
# - Handle time-reversal symmetry flag
#
# File format for use_symmetry:
# Line 1: nsymm=N (number of symmetries)
# Line 2: --- 1 --- (symmetry number)
# Lines 3-5: 3x3 rotation matrix (integers)
# Line 6: tx ty tz T/F (translation + time-reversal flag)
# Repeat for each symmetry
#
# Functions to translate:
# - read_symmetry_file: Parse use_symmetry file
# - parse_symmetry_operation: Parse single symmetry block
# - validate_symmetry: Check symmetry operations are valid
# - Interface with spglib for automatic symmetry finding
